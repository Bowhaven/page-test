In this exercise, you will use the AquaPlan app to explore the value of irrigation for agricultural production, and how this value varies between different locations and over time. You will assess the yield benefits and water requirements for irrigated maize production in three locations across the United States (Indiana, California, and Nebraska), which vary in terms of the amount and variability of rainfall received during the maize growing season (May to September). In doing so, you will learn about the value of irrigation as a means of both increasing crop yields in areas with insufficient rainfall, and reducing variability in yields in regions where rainfall varies substantially from one year to another.

# Site 1 - NAME, Indiana

## Select a field
We start by investigating the Eastern corn belt of the US, a region where the majority of agriculture is currently rainfed. Begin by launching AquaPlan ('Launch App' button at the top-right of this page) and navigating to the 'Value of Irrigation' tab. Then, enter the following coordinates (COORD HERE) in the search box to select the field in the vicinity of NAME in the state of Indiana as shown on the map below. This will automatically retrieve weather data for the site from the Daymet gridded weather dataset produced by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States along with soil properties from the global SoilGrids dataset produced by the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC).

<!-- N.B. doesn't seem like expectations of low irri requirement are met in this region? -->

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/tut_1_A.png')
```

\

## Run AquaCrop
Select the next tab 'Run AquaCrop' and browse through all of the model parameters that can be tweaked. Leave all parameters as their default values for now, but pay particular attention to the 'Irrigation' tab. This tab is where you adjust parameters of your irrigation system, including the application efficiency, maximum application rate or capacity of your irrigation system, and the levels of soil moisture (\% of soil water holding capacity) at which irrigation will be triggered in each of the crop's four main growth stages. Click the 'Run model' button to execute the model using the default set of parameters and geospatial weather and soil input data.

**Question**

How would you expect the yield and irrigation usage to change when using multiple SMTs compared to a single SMT?
::::

\

<!-- could add breakdown of each slider/parameter set here? -->

## Interpret outputs
Navigate to the 'Visualize outputs' tab, and use the checkboxes to explore  to answer the following questions.

\

:::: {.whitebox .question data-latex="{question}"}
**Question 1.a.**

Looking at the 'total rainfed and irrigation' plot, describe how the amount of rainfall and irrigation change over time. Is the amount of irrigation generally greater or less than the amount of rainfall? What could this mean for the crop system?

::::

\

:::: {.whitebox .question data-latex="{question}"}
**Question 1.b.**

Now looking at the 'rainfed vs irrigated yield' and 'irrigation water productivity' plots, do you think that rainfall in the US eastern corn belt is generally sufficient for the water requirements of maize? Use the trends you see in the two graphs to explain why you think this way.

# Step 2
## Select region
We'll now run the same model parameters but for a different point in the US. Return to the 'Select region' tab and select a point in central California, in the region shown below:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/tut_1_B.png')
```
(don't worry about the first marker still existing on the map, the model will only use the last point created)

N.B. When you return to the 'Select region' tab, your view will be zoomed in very far, either scroll down or use the '-' button on the map to zoom out.

\

## Run AquaCrop
As in the first task, go to the 'Run AquaCrop' tab and run the model again for this new location.


## Interpret outputs
Use the checkboxes on the 'Visualize outputs' tab to answer the following questions.

\

:::: {.whitebox .question data-latex="{question}"}
**Question 2.a.**

Looking at the 'total rainfed and irrigation' plot, describe how the amount of rainfall and irrigation change over time. What differences do you notice between this plot and the plot from the eastern corn belt in the first task?

::::



:::: {.whitebox .question data-latex="{question}"}
**Question 2.b.**

Look at the 'irrigation water productivity' plot. Let's breakdown the irrigated water productivity into two components: there is an associated benefit per a) kilo of maize produced and a cost per b) mm of irrigation. How then does the value of maize irrigation vary over time in central California compared with the eastern corn belt?

::::



:::: {.whitebox .question data-latex="{question}"}
**Question 2.c.**

'Yield stability' is an important concept in agriculture, with farmers generally preferring to have more predictable yields each year, even at a cost of maximum potential yield. Now looking at the 'rainfed vs irrigated yield' plot, what can you say about the yield stability of this system? How does it compare with the stability of the eastern corn belt and is there an associated yield cost?

**Again, take screenshots ('Windows key + Shift + S') to save these three plots for later reference.**

# Step 3
Using what you've learnt over the last two tasks, answer the following questions based on maize in Southwestern Nebraska.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/tut_1_C.png')
```

:::: {.whitebox .question data-latex="{question}"}
**Question 3.a.**

How does the amount and variability of rainfall differ in southwestern Nebraska compared to that of both central California and the eastern corn belt?   

::::



:::: {.whitebox .question data-latex="{question}"}
**Question 3.b.**

How does the variability in seasonal weather that you described in the previous question relate to the variation in the yield benefits of irrigation? 

::::



:::: {.whitebox .question data-latex="{question}"}
**Question 3.c.**

Do you notice any years which have particularly high levels of irrigation water productivity? Can you use differences in rainfall and irrigation requirements to explain why such years have a high value of irrigation?
