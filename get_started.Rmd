# Local installation

The AquaPlan web-app is hosted online for your convenience. However, for prolonged or intensive usage, you will find it easier to create a locally-hosted instance of AquaPlan. The following steps describe how to host AquaPlan locally on your machine, assuming no prior knowledge of hosting or cloning repositories. 

The AquaPlan repository ('repo') is currently private, so you will need to gain access before continuing with this guide.

## Create fork

We begin by creating a fork from the main AquaPlan repo. By forking the repo, we copy its contents into a duplicate repo. This acts as a safety measure to prevent unchecked changes accidentally being made to the main repo, which is currently used to generate the live web-app.

To create a fork, navigate to the AquaPlan repo, locate the 'Fork' drop-down menu (shown below) and select 'Create a new fork'. Then, follow the dialogue prompts to choose a location for your fork.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/tut_0_A.png')
```
